Run "mono_repo help <command>" for more information about a command.
```

## Configuration

To configure a package directory to be included it must contain a
`mono_pkg.yaml` file (along with the normal `pubspec.yaml` file).

You can use an empty `mono_pkg.yaml` file to enable the `check` and `pub`
commands. 

To enable `travis` and `presubmit`, you must populate `mono_pkg.yaml` with
details on how you'd like tests to be run.

### `mono_pkg.yaml` example

```yaml
# This key is required. It specifies the Dart SDKs your tests will run under
# You can provide one or more value.
# See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/dart#choosing-dart-versions-to-test-against
# for valid values
dart:
 - dev

stages:
  # Register two jobs to run under the `analyze` stage.
  - analyze:
    - dartanalyzer
    - dartfmt
  - unit_test:
    - test
```

Running `mono_repo travis` in the root directory generates two files:
`.travis.yml` and `tool/travis.sh`.
